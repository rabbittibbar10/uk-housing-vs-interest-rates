Analysis of UK house prices vs Bank of England base rate, with buy-to-let insights
# UK Housing Prices vs Interest Rates (Regional Analysis)

This project analyses how UK regional house prices change over time and how those changes relate to the Bank of England Bank Rate, with a focus on buy-to-let decision support.

## Goals
- Compare house price trends across UK regions
- Overlay and analyse interest rate changes (Bank Rate)
- Identify regions with stronger resilience or different sensitivity during rate rises
- Produce charts and a short “decision support” summary

## Data sources
- UK House Price Index (UKHPI) (monthly, by region)
- Bank of England Bank Rate (interest rate history)
- (Optional extension later) ONS private rent index

## Repo structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks (cleaning + analysis)
- `src/` - reusable Python functions
- `data/raw/` - source downloads
- `data/processed/` - cleaned datasets
- `reports/figures/` - exported charts

## How to run (coming next)
1. Create a virtual environment
2. Install dependencies
3. Run notebooks in order
